- August 8 2015

These are the R and Python scripts used for the analyses in **Substitution model adequacy and assessing the reliability of estimates of virus evolutionary rates and time scales**.

There are different directories to conduct the analyses in the paper, as follows:

- [Goldman-Cox parametric bootstrap tests, based on maximum likelihood](http://www.eltiempo.com)

- [Posterior predictive simulations using the multinomial likelihood and the chi-squared test statistics](http://www.eltiempo.com)
